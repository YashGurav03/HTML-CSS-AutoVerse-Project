    <h2>Why a Car Loan is important ?</h2>
    <p>Owning a car was once a luxurious commodity to have. But in today’s economically developing world, a car is a necessity and convenience to travel from one corner of the ever-expanding city to the other. 
        Though everybody may not have enough cash to purchase the car with a lump-sum payment, numerous lenders can help you realise your dream of buying the car through a car loan. 
        Applying for a car loan is now hassle-free, easy, and paperless. Just make a few clicks, and you can submit the car loan application form online. Almost every bank today offers car loans at attractive interest rates. Based on one’s affordability, it is now quite easy to take a car loan and then pay EMIs without really biting into a person’s finances.
        </p>
    <h2>Features and Benefits of Car Loan</h2>
        <p>
            Get financing for purchasing new and used cars.<br>
            The financing can go up to 85%-90% of the on-road price of the car. Some banks offer up to 100% financing on the vehicle’s on-road price to certain conditions.<br>
            The loan tenure can range from one year up to seven years.<br>
            The loan amount can be up to three times the annual income of the applicant.<br>
            Some lenders offer instant financing facilities for cars.<br>
            You may get additional discounts and offers if you choose to purchase a car from the dealer or manufacturer the bank has a tie-up with.<br>
            The car purchased through financing will be held as collateral until the loan is repaid.<br>
            The repayment structure most commonly followed for a car loan is equated monthly instalments (EMI).</p>
    <h2>Factors Affecting Car Loan</h2>
        <b>Credit score</b>
        <p>Your lender will enquire about your credit score to understand your creditworthiness. Based on your report and score, the lender will take a call on the loan amount they are willing to lend you and the associated terms and conditions.</p>
        <b>Debt-to-income ratio</b>
        <p>Lenders assess your income and the commitments you have to cater to at the end of the month to see if the new car loan and its EMIs fit in your budget. The lender will determine your ability to take a new loan and stand by it through the debt-to-income (DTI) ratio. If you have a high DTI score, you will get a lower loan amount irrespective of your income. There is the risk of your loan terms being stringent.</p>
        <b>Down payment</b>
        <p>Every car loan comes with a defined margin. Margin, here, means the amount of money or the percentage of the on-road car price that you will have to pay from your pocket. Though there are 100% financing loan schemes available in the market, they are subject to conditions. 
            It is always favourable for you to save some money and use it as a downpayment so you can borrow less and pay less interest to the bank, reducing the total cost of car ownership. Lenders also prefer that you make a certain downpayment from your end. This gives the lenders a sense of guarantee that you are good at planning and managing your money well and will not bail out of the repayments suddenly.</p>
        <b>Age of vehicle</b>
        <p>In the case of used car loans, the age of the vehicle matters a lot in deciding the interest rate; it is a deciding factor in accepting or rejecting the loan application</p>
     <h2>Eligibility Criteria</h2>
        <p>Certain eligibility conditions should be met to go for a car loan, and one must make sure they have a proper understanding of that. Let’s see what these factors that will decide if you are eligible to buy a car are:<br>
